This design of 3 types structures asI explain in the other answers is a practice to design a small data structure to search,
insert, count and connect different type of data like the screen is connected with the pixells and then utilize those pixells inside the screen class
to automatizy a real screen.

The same for the line class to search any type of 
elements in this case persons, also could be used to delete, insert, search and count other objects and sub objects
like merchandise and prices, cities and their street.
