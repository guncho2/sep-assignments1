How does your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the data?

At the screen.rb is accesed through the Screen class which comes and bring the data from
the pixel class where pixel class brings the pixel parameters 

If a developer wanted to find a specific element in your data structure, how would you search for it?

At the screen class structure a developer could find the witdth and height and also a matrix is preparaed to find those parameters neted (heigth) inside the width
to find the square pixels intersection parameter

Through the insertion of pixells colors parameters insert(pixels,x y)
wecreate a matrix to to have the pixelsat the screen class

Once thismatrix is ready we can search and return the pixels on the screen
at()

With the inbound() function we ask if one of those pixels are out of the 
heigth and width parameters if not we discharge those pixels.

What other real-world data can each structure represent?

this type of structure couldbe used in any digital screen and also could be a start
touse as a graphical data structure to design UI grphic and 
interelationed with other programs to design draws graphicaldesigns 
or even cloudbe used as a geographical map.

Personally I think that adding a third dimension it could be used to design a space map
like a sky or a maritime cart. Astronomical calculus also however is too much right now.

Designing a plane or a missile trajectory? or even a three diemnsional game.
