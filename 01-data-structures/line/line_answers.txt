How does your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the data?
The data structure allwthe developers tomanipulate them through the  self.members = [] array and through the line class
Also they cn manipulate the data accessing the search array  through the search and index functions at the .rb files where any of them could
initiate a search ofpersons on the array as weel the join and delete methods to do it from the line of peoples.

If a developer wanted to find a specific element in your data structure, how would you search for it?

As I said on the previous answer through the search definition.
What other real-world data can each structure represent?
Any counting, sorting or search of elements like persons, merchandise, numbers or an array of objects.
